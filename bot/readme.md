## Premium

1. Use copy-paste mode of forwarding 
  *Purpose*: Remove "Forwarded from" header (aka "link to the sourcing channel") from redirected messages
2. Connect Telegram account to Bot
  *Purpose*: Setup redirections from channels you don't have an invitation link for, but are a member of, which is the per-requisite for setting up redirections from/to bots, groups, people and transformation feature.
3. Enable Transformation
  *Purpose*: Replace particular words in messages with your own words.  Remove particular words or phrases in messages
4. Setup redirections from/to bots, groups, or people each direction 
5. The FREE version only offers up to **10 active redirections** on your list.
  I would like the ability for PAID subscribers to buy package of **50 additional redirections**.
  Admin has the ability to specify any # of redirections.
  Limit up to 100,000 redirections.
  No limit – unlimited would be great to have as well.


# WORKFLOW
1. Setup redirections from Bot, Channel (not an Admin), user -->  Bot, Channel or user.
  Will need to Connect Telegram account to Bot for this to work from what I’ve gathered in my Research.
  Connect to telegram account to Bot also required to enable transformation & copy-paste forwarding feature.
2. Enable transformation to replace a particular word from message (e.g. Tier: Gold -> Plan: Platinum)
3. Enable copy-paste of Forwarding to remove "Forwarded from" header (aka "link to the sourcing channel") from redirected messages – hiding source
4. Apply Filter to remove images, links, hashtags or certain keywords
5. Apply Filter to forward a message containing a specific keyword/phrase to specific Bot, Channel or user– redirection.  
  * Example#1: if message contains the keyword/phrase: “Plan: Platinum” -> Channel #1, Bot#1 or user#1.
  * Example#2: if message contains the keyword/phrase: “Plan: Gold” -> Channel#2, Bot#2 or user#2.
  * Example#3: if message contains the keyword/phrase: “Plan: Silver” -> Channel#3, Bot#3 or user#3.


# Filters (/filter)

Command format:

```/filter FILTER_NAME REDIRECTION_ID STATE```

**Available filters**:

- photos
- documents
- audios
- stickers
- videos
- links
- hashtags
- contains
- notContains



### Procedure

Example command
```
/add <source> <destination>
```

#### 1. Check the entity format. 
  - Usernames must start with '@"
  - Invitation links must start with 'https://t.me/joinchat' or 't.me/joinchat'
  - Should return an object

*Example Response*

  ```js
  // Response for username
  {
    'username': 'adityathebe',
  }

  // Response for invitation link
  { 
    'hash': 'xyzjskdl123'
  }

  // If neither
  {
    'error': 'Invalid format'
  }

  ```

#### 2. Get both the entities from the API
 
```js
ForwardAgent.getEntity(entity)
```

Need to make sure the entities are valid before we send a join request to them.

> **NOTE:** This check is important because a request to join an entity where the agent is already a participant of will result in an error.

Should return an object in case of success

```js

// User Entity
{
  joinable: true,
  accessHash: 'kjsdfkasd1234kl1j',
  bot: true, // false
  title: 'adityathebe',
  chatId: '491823011',
}

// Channel Entity
{
  joinable: true,
  chatId: '023129382',
  title: 'Best Channel',
  accessHash: 'kjasdf902134j',
  megagroup: true, // false
  left: true, //false
}

// Unreachable Invitation link
{
  joinable: true,
}
```

In any other case, will return an error object

#### 3. Send Join Request

```js
// Private Entity
ForwardAgent.joinPrivateEntity(hash)

// Public Entity
ForwardAgent.joinPublicEntity(entity)
```

#### 4. Check if redirection already exists for the user

```js
database.getRedirection(owner)
```

#### 5. Store to database

Store redirection

- src_title
- src_chat_id
- src_username
- dest_title
- dest_chat_id
- dest_username
- owner
