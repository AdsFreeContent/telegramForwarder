- Agent can join Public chanels but not private chhanels, groups, users, & bots.
- Telethon returns an error if user is already a participant <telethon.errors.rpcerrorlist.UserAlreadyParticipantError>.
- Telegram has limitation to join channels so FML. Will need multiple agents
- Instead of saving user input of the source and destination, the username, name and chat_id should be fetched and saved.
